# WithcraftClassic
A game engine written in C++ and OpenGL.  This is an older version of the engine.

The version of Witchcraft in this repository is the most-developed version of the engine that exists.  It features skeletal animation, shadow mapping, and basic movement collision.  I've abandoned this version in favor of a rewrite for Vulkan and to clean up a number of backend problems.  The newest (but less complete) version of the engine can be found at https://github.com/HaydnVH/Witchcraft .
